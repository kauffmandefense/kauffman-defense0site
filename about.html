        <h1>About Kauffman Defense</h1>
        <p>At Kauffman Defense, we are dedicated to providing high-quality CPL training in Michigan. Our experienced instructors ensure you receive the best education on firearm safety, self-defense, and the legal aspects of carrying concealed.</p>

            <h2>Taylor - Instructor</h2>
            <p>I have served in the Michigan Army National Guard since 2012, beginning my military career as a Small Arms / Artillery Repairman. My experience has given me extensive knowledge of firearms maintenance, handling, and safety.</p>
            <p>In addition to my military service, I spent three years as a corrections officer at a state prison, where I gained valuable experience in security, situational awareness, and defensive tactics. Following that, I served for six years as a full-time Artillery Repairman for the National Guard and continue to serve as a full-time National Guardsman today. In my role, I frequently instruct soldiers on marksmanship and firearms safety, ensuring they develop the skills necessary to handle weapons effectively and responsibly.</p>
            <p>I have been a certified Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners (MCRGO) instructor since 2020, allowing me to provide high-quality Concealed Pistol License (CPL) training that meets the state's requirements. My goal is to ensure that every student leaves the class with the confidence and skills necessary to carry responsibly, understanding the legal and practical aspects of self-defense. Whether you are new to firearms or an experienced shooter, my focus is on safety, situational awareness, and real-world application.</p>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not teaching, I enjoy hunting, fishing, shooting, and spending time outdoors.</p>

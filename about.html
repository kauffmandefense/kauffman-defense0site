        <h1>About Kauffman Defense</h1>
        <p>At Kauffman Defense, we are dedicated to providing high-quality CPL training in Michigan. Our experienced instructors ensure you receive the best education on firearm safety, self-defense, and the legal aspects of carrying concealed.</p>

            <h2>Taylor - Instructor</h2>
            <p>With over a decade of experience in both military service and firearms instruction, I’m dedicated to providing top-tier CPL training to ensure my students are confident, responsible, and well-prepared to carry concealed in Michigan.</p>
            <p>I have proudly served in the Michigan Army National Guard since 2012, beginning my career as a Small Arms/Artillery Repairman. This role provided me with extensive hands-on experience in firearms maintenance, handling, and safety. As a full-time National Guardsman, I regularly instruct Soldiers on marksmanship, firearms safety, and defensive tactics, which has honed my ability to teach and empower others.</p>
            <p>As a certified Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners (MCRGO) instructor since 2020, I am passionate about delivering high-quality CPL training that meets Michigan’s strict standards. My goal is to ensure that every student leaves the class with the confidence and skills needed to carry responsibly, understand the legal and practical aspects of self-defense, and make informed decisions under pressure.</p>
            <p>Whether you are new to firearms or an experienced shooter, I tailor my courses to meet the needs of all students, focusing on safety, situational awareness, and real-world application. My teaching style emphasizes hands-on practice and preparing students for real-world scenarios.</p>
            <p>Since becoming an instructor, I’ve trained many individuals who have gone on to become certified CPL holders. The feedback I receive is a testament to my commitment to providing a supportive and thorough learning environment.</p>
            <p>When I’m not in the classroom, you can find me enjoying hunting, fishing, shooting, and spending time outdoors. My passion for firearms and safety is what drives me to provide the best possible training for every student.</p>

            <h2>Kristin - Instructor</h2>
            <p>With a passion for firearms and personal defense, I am committed to providing high-quality CPL training that empowers students with the knowledge and confidence to carry safely and responsibly in Michigan.</p>
            <p>I have been shooting since before the age of 10, gaining experience in both target shooting and hunting. While I do not have a military or law enforcement background, I bring years of hands-on firearms experience and a deep understanding of marksmanship and personal protection. My journey as an instructor began in 2020 when I became a Range Officer, ensuring safety and proper firearms handling on the range. In 2023, I became a certified CPL instructor through the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners (MCRGO), allowing me to expand my ability to educate and train responsible firearm owners.</p>
            <p>In my instruction, I emphasize safety, legal considerations, and responsible concealed carry practices. As a woman in a traditionally male-dominated field, I offer a unique perspective on self-defense, carrying options, and practical accessories tailored to different needs. My expertise lies in marksmanship instruction and concealed carry tactics, helping students develop confidence in their shooting skills and decision-making under pressure.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have trained hundreds of students in proper marksmanship and firearm safety. My goal is to create a welcoming and informative learning environment where all students—whether beginners or experienced shooters—can improve their skills and gain the knowledge necessary to protect themselves and their loved ones.</p>
            <p>Outside of the classroom and range, I enjoy hunting, fishing, camping, and backpacking. My love for the outdoors and self-reliance fuels my dedication to teaching responsible firearm ownership and personal protection.</p>
